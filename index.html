<p> My favorite Hobby is Playing Games in my free time. After you complete my homework (including practicing piano, coding etc.) I finally get to play some games. Here's my history of playing games, I started playing games when I got my first phone. I found more Everyone-Rated games when my cousin showed me some. Most games have some educational learning, so you might play those games for more learning. Playing games is a good free time after doing homework, practice, and doing all the chores, and be able to play games after that. So if you want something to play after doing studying, practicing, and doing chores, sometimes you can play games once you got permission. </p>
